<p class="head1">About me</p>
<p class="body1_l">Greetings, I am M. Rachit, the developer of this website.<br>
  I would like to inform you that the website is still under development, and I am currently working to complete it.<br>
  With four years of experience in the Python programming language, and three months of experience in HTML and CSS, I am capable of developing high-quality Python programs and beginner-friendly websites.<br>
  My passion for coding and gaming has led me to create a YouTube channel where I upload my gaming videos.<br>
  My ultimate goal for this website is to transform it into a platform where I can showcase my projects.
